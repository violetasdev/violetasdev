### Hola! Hi! Hallo! 👋

My name is Violeta, and currently, I am a PhD candidate in Geoinformatics in Germany. My research focuses on solving problems related to Spatial Cognition and Computer Science. At the moment I work on processing skeleton tracking data for human behaviour analysis in indoors :walking:

In the past, I participated as a team leader and full-stack software developer focused on integrating web ecosystems. My responsibilities included participating in architecture and web design, platform deployment, back-end development, technology integration, and project management. :computer:
