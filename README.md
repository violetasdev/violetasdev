<h1 align='center'> Hola! Hi! Hallo! 👋</h1> 

<br>

```python
I am Violeta, a Colombian software developer with experience in 
    microservices architecture, 
    web design, databases, and project management,
    integrating different technologies 
    for private and public sectors. 

Curious about the potential application of dev skills in other fields, 
    I decided to pursue a Ph.D. in Geoinformatics
    in a second (almost third) language in a different country!

I am a developer and researcher, who create tools to 
    analyze human behavior using Spatio-temporal data. 
 
But, how does that work?
    This research helps us understand how we interact to improve 
    > the services we use, 
    > the places we explore, 
    > and the artificial agents we create.

I love to learn about 
    * data science, 
    * computer vision, 
    * software development,
    * and human behavior. 
    
Also, I am learning to fly drones 🛸 and play golf ⛳️

Let's share thoughts about education and job opportunities in tech!
